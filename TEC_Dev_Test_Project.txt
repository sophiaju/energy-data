TEC Energy Dev Candidate Project:

Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a software project which when launched will download CSVs from the internet, parse and validate the data contained in the CSVs and then insert it into a relational database.

The CSVs describe the shipment of natural gas. There are CSVs published multiple times a day (each day is divided into cycles). We want all the data from the first 3 days of the month of March 2022 (Mar 1st, 2nd, 3rd).

If you can write code which can fetch data from any set of days, this is a bonus.

If you can write code which tracks what data has already been fetched, and avoids redownloding data, this is also a bonus.

Deliverables:

DDL of a database table(s) where the data will be inserted. (Postgres SQL preferred, but any relational DB is okay)
The necessary query to insert this data.
The code to facilitate the downloading, validation, and insert of the data. (C# prefered but feel free to use another language if you want to)
Instructions on how to run the code.

The deliverables should all be uploaded to a public git repository (like GitHub)

The site where the data is found:
https://twtransfer.energytransfer.com/ipost/TW/capacity/operationally-available
